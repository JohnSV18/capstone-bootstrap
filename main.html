      <p class="text-lg-center">  Promoting growth and development through competitive soccer in Queens, New York. Eastern Queens F.C. was founded
        in 2016 by Jonathan and Jimmy Puma. They grew up playing travel soccer throughout their childhood, but had to travel
        over an hour out of Queens just to be able to compete at the highest level. Soon they realized, they aren’t the only
        people from Queens who were forced to travel outside of the borough in order to play competitive and organized soccer.
        With so much passion and talent produced in Queens, it was time for a club to reflect that determination and dedication.
        Eastern Queens F.C. aims to bring that same level of elite competition to the people of Queens.</p>
